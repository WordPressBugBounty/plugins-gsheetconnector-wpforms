Connect WPForms to Google Sheets and automatically send form entries to a google sheet in real-time. No manual exports, no coding required.

== Description ==

Automatically send WPForms entries to Google Sheets in real-time.

**GSheetConnector for WPForms** is a powerful and user-friendly add-on that connects your [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) website running **[WPForms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/)** with **[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)** and automatically saves every form submission into a connected spreadsheet.

When a visitor submits a form on your website, the data is instantly synced to Google Sheets — no manual export, no copy-paste, and no coding required. This makes it easy to manage, share, and analyze WPForms entries directly inside Google Sheets.

This plugin works with both **[WPForms Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/)** and **[WPForms Pro](https://wpforms.com/pricing/)** and allows you to build a complete **WPForms to Google Sheets automation system** without writing any code.

    $tags['query_var key="wpformstest"'] = 'Query String Variable';
    return $tags;
}
